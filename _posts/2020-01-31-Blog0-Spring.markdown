 The purpose behind Lab A for the CIT 160 class is to introduce CIT students to using shells to access remote servers through 
the popular program Docker. SSH and Docker requires the students to go to other URLs to download programs for installation with options for MAC, Linux machines, and Windows. Accessing SSH through the CSUN sandbox and setting the CIT 160 container required for the student to follow a specific set of commands that the student could easily misread or skip if they are not paying enough attention. Spacing the
instructions in the word document would help the student read the commands more thoroughly and better understand the purpose behind each command. The lab can be seen as simple to a student that reads through all the instructions and
,but can quite easily become confusing when students attempt to rush or have their attentions elsewhere when completing their lab. Giving students an easier way to distinguish each command with more spacing between the lines and making the 
lab more interactive would be very useful. Making the students more interested in what they are doing would help prevent any easily avoidable mistakes.
