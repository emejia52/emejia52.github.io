Creating new EC2 Instances on AWS is fairly easy and can be very cost effective. 

The first step in setting up the EC2 is selecting a instance, which can be a Linux or Windows instance, and for the sake of this blog I will select the Linux instance Amazon Linux AMI. 

Next in the Configure Instance Details I have to add an initialization script that will install and start the Apache serve. 

#! /bin/sh   <br>
Yum -y install httpd php  <br>
Chkconfig httpd on  <br>
/etc/init.d/httpd start  <br>

For the Add Storage section keep the default setting, and add a Tag instance with a name in the Value box to identify the EC2 instance earlier. 

Add a security group in the Configure Security Group/ Then proceed to click Add Rule withe Type HTTP which will allow for requests from the internet. 

In the Key pair dialog box select new Key pair, enter the name of key pair, and download it as a PEM file placing it in a secure folder. Finally click Launch Instance and ensure the status of the instance is running. 

To connect to the EC2 instance from a Windows computer open a command prompt inside of the folder that contains your PEM file and enter the command: 

# ssh -i [name of my pem file] ec2-user@<public DNS>
