	The purpose behind Lab A for the CIT 160 class is to introduce CIT students to using shells to access remote servers through 
the popular program Docker. SSH and Docker requires the students to go to other URLs to download programs for installation with options for 
MAC, Linux machines, and Windows. Accessing SSH through the CSUN sandbox and setting the CIT 160 container requires for the student to 
follow a specific set of commands that the student could misread or skip a step of they are not paying enough attention. Spacing the 
instructions in teh word document would help the student from skipping commands and better understand the purpose behind each command.
